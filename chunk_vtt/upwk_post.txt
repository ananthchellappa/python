Something that doesn't exist (according to Google). A good one to build up your profile on Upwork!

When you record a Teams meeting and then generate a transcript, you get a .vtt file with is a Web Video Transcript Texts file.

It looks like this (at start) (note that the right angle bracket was removed from --right-ang-brack to meet Upwork requirements for posting)

00:00:02.350 -- 00:00:06.630
Ok everyone lets get starter
welcome to the meeting.

00:00:06.630 -- 00:00:11.201
thanks for joining , it may be
late at your end

You get the idea.. It presents the output in about four second chunk - making it difficult to go in and search and edit.

Some portions, you don't care, but some portions, you want to make corrections.

It's difficult if it's in four second chunks.

We want a script that we can run as

prompt $ chunk_vtt.pl filename.vtt 1.5

The 1.5 above is the chunk time in MINUTES. So, 1.5 means 90 seconds. Therefore, 0.1 would mean six seconds.

What do we do in the case of the user starting with a file that has four second chunks and wanting six second chunks? (not a practical case, but a good one to test anyway)

input :  4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24,     # showing the end time of the chunks assuming start at 0 sec
output : 8, 16, 24, 30

you get the idea - in the output, each chunk must be AT LEAST six seconds - therefore, we can expect at least two chunks from the input in each output chunk.

So, the output will have the correct timestamps from the input and the aggregated text (don't change number of characters on line, etc)

Keep in mind that you cannot assume anything about the input chunks - which is why the timestamps are there - they can be of varying length from one to the next.

When you submit, you can run these test cases on the attached file and send me the result

12 seconds (so the argument would be 0.2
1 minute
5 minutes
