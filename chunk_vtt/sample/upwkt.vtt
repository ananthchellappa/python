00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.630
You look smart, Mr. Blackadder. Going somewhere nice?

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.201
Don't you like it then?
No, I don't! A load of stupid actors strutting around,

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:15.700
shouting, with their chests thrust out so far, you'd think their
nipples were attached to a pair of charging elephants! And the worst

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.870
thing about it is having to go with Prince *Mini-Brain*!
What, doesn't he like it, either?


00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.478
No, no, he loves it. The problem is that he doesn't realise it's *made

00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:32.040
up*. Last year, when Brutus was about to kill Julius Caesar, the
Prince yelled out, "Look behind you, Mr. Caesar!".

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.732
I don't see a point in the theatre. All that sex and violence. I get
enough of that at home. Except for the sex, of course.

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:40.320
While we're out, Baldrick, I want you to give this palace a good
*clean*. It's so dirty, it'll be unacceptable to a dung-beetle that

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.792
had lost interest in its career and really let itself go.
Come on, Blackadder, or we'll miss the first act!

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:46.050
Coming, sir, as fast as I can... Stick the kettle on, Baldrick.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.640
Now Sir, give I this advice to thee: Never never trust thine enemy.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.083
Thy life is forfeit, sir, and at an end, like our poor play.
We hope it  pleased you, friends.

00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:57.030
Certainly not, you murdering rotter! Guards, arrest that man!

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.750
Your Highness, it's only a play.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.829
Oh, well, that's all very well, but that about the poor fellow who's
*dead*? Saying it's only a play will not feed and clothe the little

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.676
ones he leaves behind!  Call the militia!
But sir, he's not dead. See, he stands, awaiting your applause.

00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:12.287
Oh, I say, that's very clever. He really isn't dead.  Oh Bravo! Bravo!


00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:15.838
Blast, the Prince likes it!

00:01:15.838 --> 00:01:19.685
Oh shit, we'll close tonight.


00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:22.290
Right, everybody out! Smash the Spinning Jenny! Burn the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.430
rolling Rosalind! Destroy the going-up-and-down-a-bit-and-then-moving-
along Gertrude! And death to the stupid Prince who grows fat on the
profits!

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.656
I say, how exciting! This play's getting better and better! Bravo! Bravo!

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:31.877
It's not a play anymore, sir. Put the bomb
down and make your way quietly to the exit.

00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:35.098
Blackadder, you old thing, your problem is you can't tell when
something's real and when it's not!

00:01:35.098 --> 00:01:38.160
I must say, Blackadder, that was a close shave! Why on earth would an
anarchist possibly want to kill *you*?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.275
I think it might've been *you* he was after, sir.

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:44.285
Oh hogwash! What on earth makes you say that?

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:47.506
Well, my suspicions were first aroused by his
use of the words, Death to the stupid Prince

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:50.251
It was a bit rude, wasn't it?

00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:53.683
These are volatile times, your Highness. The American Revolution lost
your father the Colonies, the French Revolution murdered brave King

00:01:53.683 --> 00:01:56.059
Louis and there are tremendous rumblings in Prussia, although that
might have something to do with the sausages. The whole world cries
out, Peace, Freedom, and a few less fat bastards eating all the pie.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.890
Well, yes, quite, something must be done! Any ideas?

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.220
Yes sir. Next week is your royal father's birthday celebrations. I
suggest that I write a brilliant speech for you to recite to show the
oppressed masses how unusually sensitive you are.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.419
Well, tell me about these oppressed masses, what are
they so worked up about?

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:10.160
They're worked up, sir, because they're so poor, they're forced to
have children simply to provide a cheap alternative to turkey at

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.090
Christmas. Disease and depravation stalk our land like.. two giant..
stalking things. And the working man is poised to overthrow us.


00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.060
Oh my God, and here he is!


00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.580
Don't be silly, sir. That's Baldrick, my dogsbody.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.730
What's silly about that? He looks like an oppressed mass to me. Get
him out of here at once

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.990
Shoo, Baldrick, carry on with your cleaning elsewhere. And by the end
of tonight, I want that dining table so clean I can eat my dinner off
it.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.709
Cripes, Blackadder, I'm dicing with death here. The sooner I can show
how unusually sensitive I am, the better. Oh, I just had
another brilliant thought.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.130
Another one, Your Highness?

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.026
Yes, another one, actually! You remember that one I, I had about, uh,
wearing underwear on the outside to save on laundry bills? Well, what

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:52.509
I'm thinking to myself is, "Hello, why don't we ask those two actor
chappies we saw tonight to teach me how to recite your speech?"
Brilliant, eh?

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:57.285
No, Your Highness, feeble.
What?

00:02:57.285 --> 00:02:59.270
It's a feeble thought. I would advise
against it

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.240
ll, tish-and-pish to your advice, Blackadder! Get them here at once!
Damn it, I'd fed up with you treating me as if I'm sort of like some

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.020
kind of a thickie! It's not me that's thick, it's you and you know
why? Because I'm a bloody Prince and you're only a *butler*. And now
go and get those actors here this minute, Mr. Thicky-Black-Thicky-
Adder-Thicky.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.350
Mrs. Miggins, I'm looking for a couple of actors

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.180
Well, you've come to the right place, Mr. B. There's more
Shakespearian dialogue in here than there are buns! (laughs) All my

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.690
lovely actors pop in on their way to rehearsals for a little cup of
coffee and a big dollop of inspiration.


00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.390
You mean they actually rehearse? I thought they just got drunk, stuck
on a silly hat and trusted to luck.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.410
Ohhh no. There's ever so much hard work that goes into the wonderful
magic that is theatre today. Haa-haa... still I don't expect you'd

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.350
know much about that, being only a little butler.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.680
They do say, Mrs. M, that verbal insults hurt more than physical
pain.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.180
They are, of course, wrong, as
you'll soon discover when I stick this toasting fork in your head

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.490
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome Mr. David
Keanrick.


00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.170
Oh hurrah

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.120
And the fabulous Mr. Enoch Mossop

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.654
Gentlemen, gentlemen

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:02.489
Settle down, settle down, settle down

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.494
I'm sorry, no autographs

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:12.669
The usual, Mrs. M.
coming up, my lovely.


00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.130
Ahh, if I can just
squeeze through this admiring rabble

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.020
Gentlemen, I've come with a proposition

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.619
How dare you, sir. You think, just because we're actors, 
we sleep with     everyone

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:27.710
I think, being actors, you're lucky to sleep with *anyone*. I come
here on behalf of my employer, to ask for some elocution lessons.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.040
Haa-ha, I fear, that is quite impossible. We are in the middle of
rehearsing for our new play. We cannot possibly betray our beloved
audience by taking time off.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.117
Oh no, mustn't upset the punters. Bums on seats, laddie, bums on seats.

00:04:34.117 --> 00:04:36.490
It is a piece we penned ourselves, called The Bloody Murder of the
Foul Prince Romero and His Enormous-Bosomed Wife

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.090
A philosophical work then

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.220
Indeed yes, sir. The violence of the murder and the vastness of the
bosom are entirely justified artistically.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.550
Right, I'll tell the Prince that you can't make it.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.900
Prince
Sorry, yes. Didn't I mention that? It's the Prince Regent. Sorry you
can't make it. So

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.640
No, no, no, no please, no. Please wait, sir. 
Off, off! I think we can find some time, do you not,
Mr. Keanrick?

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.050
Definitely, Mr. Mossop

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.900
No, no, you've got your beloved audience to think about.


00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.221
Sod the proles! We'll come

00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:11.198
Yes, worthless bastards to a man.


00:05:11.198 --> 00:05:15.111
It's nice to see artistic integrity thriving so strongly in the
theatre. Well, this afternoon at four then, at the Palace.

00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:17.100
Well, what do you think?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.370
Are you ill or something?


00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.419
No, I'm simply trying to look more like an actor.

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.810
Well, I'm sure you don't need the false moustache.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.549
no
Egads, it's that oppressed mass again

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:33.228
No sir, that is Baldrick spring cleaning

00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:37.294
Oh yes, so it isOh yes, so it is

00:05:37.294 --> 00:05:41.295
finish the job later, Baldrick

00:05:41.295 --> 00:05:45.297
which sir. The cleaning or the being strangled

00:05:45.297 --> 00:05:47.750
Either suits me
